		<h3>Convex Functions</h3>

		<p>
		In preparation for a post about the gamma function, I thought
		it would be fitting to first review <i>convex functions</i> and
		their properties. First, a definition.
		</p>
	
		<p>        <?-- Definition of a convex function -->
		<b>
		A function is convex if and only if the function is less than
		or equal to a straight line between any two points in its
		domain.
		</b>
		</p>

		<p>
		In other words, convex functions are bowl shaped in between any
		two points, such that if a straight line were drawn in between
		these two points, the function would never cross the line. This
		definition is good for functions that map to the real numbers
		&#x211D;.
		</p>

		<p>
		A function that maps to the extended real numbers (i.e. the
		real numbers and plus infinity and negative infinity) can also
		be convex. But one has to be careful about the points selected.
		</p>

		<p>
		First of all, the line joining two points along the function
		can get us into trouble. The easiest way to define a line
		between two points is to use a parameterization. But if the
		parameterization variable is zero, then we could potentially
		multiply infinity by zero! This is undefined behavior. The
		remedy is to exclude the two end points from the definition of
		convexity &mdash; so convexity is defined on the open set
		between any two points of a function. The two points will form
		a set of measure zero, so we do not get into too much trouble
		doing this.
		</p>

		<p>
		The second issue is the addition in the parameterization,
		because the sum of positive infinity and negative infinity is
		undefined. To remedy this, we permit the function that maps to
		the extended real numbers is not allowed to take both positive
		<b>and</b> negative infinity as values. Take your pick, only
		one is usually allowed.
		</p>

		<p>
		Sometimes, people emphasize whether or not the convex function
		ever touches the bounding line. Recall, a convex function is
		defined as a function less than <i>or equal to</i> a line
		joining any two points along the function. If the function is
		never equal to the straight line, then the function is a
		<i>strictly-convex</i> function.
		</p>

		<h4>Properties</h4>

		<p>
		Convexity is a powerful property, and much can be said about
		convex functions. I will cover some basic results about convex
		functions that are useful to know.
		</p>

		<p>
		<b>The sum of convex functions is a convex function.</b><br>
		This is intuitive. Two bowl shaped functions, when summed, will
		still appear to be bowl shaped.
		</p>

		<p>
		<b>The limit of a convergent sequence of convex functions is a convex function.</b><br>
		This is merely the limiting case of the previous argument.
		</p>

		<p>
		<b>The limit of a convergent series of convex functions is a convex function.</b><br>
		Each partial sum of the series will be a convex function. Since
		the limit of the series is defined as the limit of the sequence of
		partial sums, the series will converge to a convex function.
		</p>

		<p>
		<b>A function is convex if and only if the function has monotonically increasing one-sided derivatives.</b><br>
		A convex function's derivatives can only go up or stay
		constant. If the derivatives ever got smaller, then there would
		be a location where we could fit a line under the function.
		This result is often stated a little more loosely: a function
		is convex if an only if its second derivative, or curvature, is
		greater than or equal to zero.
		</p>

		<p>
		<b>A minimum of a convex function is the global minimum.</b><br>
		Think bowl shaped. There can only be one bottom.
		</p>

		<p>
		<b>Jensen's inequality applies to every convex function.</b><br>
		Jensen's inequality says that the value of a convex function at
		an integral will be less than or equal to the integral of the
		convex function. This statement is a generalization of the
		definition of a convex function &mdash; that is, that the
		function will live below a straight line joining two points. So
		we can change what it means to measure some function, but we do
		not have to leave behind the ideas of convexity.
		</p>

		<b>A constant function is convex.</b><br>
