		<h3>Analytic Functions</h3>

        	<p>
		I have just discovered that infinite differentiability
		at all points in its domain is not enough to show that
		a function is analytic. Here differentiability is performed
		in the real sense, not complex. An analytic function is defined
		as a function with a power series that converges to the
		function at all points in its domain. This is remarkable
		to me.
		</p>

		<p>
		In other words, it is not enough for the real derivative of
		a function to exist at the point, but it also must
		exist in the neighborhood of the point! If this is true
		for all points in the function's domain, then the function
		is analytic.
		</p>

		<p>
		Imagine there is just one point of the function that is
		being difficult. If the function is analytic, one can
		cover the point by Taylor series expansions of the
		neighboring points. Like patching a bike tire, and 
		the patch would be like the Taylor series approximation.
		</p>

		<p>
		Recall that a complex function is analytic if and only
		if it is holomorphic &mdash; that is, if it is complex
		differentiable. The terms are used interchangably. If one
		can show that a complex function is complex differentiable
		on an open set, then this does imply analyticity.
