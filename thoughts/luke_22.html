		<h3>Luke 22</h3>
        <p>My thoughts regarding the 22<sup>nd</sup> division of the gospel of Luke.</p>

        <p> <?-- Exodus 13:3 -->
        <i>
        Remember the day in which you went out of Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for
        by the strength of the hand of the LORD brought you out of this place. No leavened
        bread shall be eaten.
        </i><br>Exodus 13:3
        </p>

        <p>
        This passage begins by introducing the scribes desire to murder the Christ.
        Judas Iscariot decides to help them, and betray his master. Christ understands
        that this betrayal is coming, which we can infer because he says this during
        the Passover meal: <i>the hand of my betrayer is with me on the table</i>.
        </p>

        <p>
        That he understands his fate is clear in several other statements he makes during
        his final hours. As dinner begins, Christ says that <i>before I suffer</i> taking
        the passover was something he longed. He understood that the hour of his suffering
        was drawing close.
        </p>

        <p>
        That he was aware the scripture would be fulfilled in him is evident by the remark
        after his teaching: <i>this which is written must still be accomplished in me:
        and he was numbered among the transgressors. For the things concerning me have an
        end.</i> Twice he says (in different ways) that the scriptures would be fulfilled
        in him. First by the word accomplished. Then by the word end. That which is written
        and the things concerning him are one and the same. The repitition seems to be a
        way of emphasis &mdash; the scriptures will be fulfilled. And what is the specific
        topic to be fulfilled? That he is to be considered, judged, and condemned as a
        transgressor.
        </p>

        <p>
        Rather than avoid this fate, he makes certain it will happen. He
        instructs his disciples to equip themselves with weapons. This is
        something them have seemingly never had need of. As he is arrested, the
        disciples use their weapons to defend their master.  Does he encourage
        their use of weapons? I do not think so, because imemdiately after the
        servant of the high priest (the person arresting him) looses an ear to
        a sword, Christ heals him. And afterwards he speaks to his followers:
        <i>permit this</i>. This is his response to the earlier question:
        <i>Lord, shall we strike him with the sword?</i> Seemingly not. He is
        prepared to be arrested.
        </p>

        <p>
        As he is betrayed, Judas Iscariot draws near to kiss his master. Before the
        rest of the disciples understand what the approaching multitude means,
        Christ asks Judas Iscariot <i>are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?</i>
        He identifies the betrayal immediately.
        </p>

        <p>
        Christ's knowledge of what is coming is revealed in his prayer.
        To the Father, he prays: <i>if it is not your will, take this cup from me;
        nevertheless, not my will but yours, be done</i>. He does not desire the
        suffering, but he is ready to endure it because he knows it is his Father's
        will. Does he equate what is written in the scripture to the Father's will?
        Not necessarily I do not think. I would argue no because he asks the Father
        to take this cup away &mdash; something that would be unusual, seeing as
        what was written clearly testifies that the Son of Man must suffer. This
        may be indication that the Father's will may superscede that which is
        written in the scripture. I am not entirely sure what to make of this yet.
        </p>

        <p>
        As he breaks the bread during passover, he tells his disciples it is
        his <i>body, which is given for you</i>. Likewise, the wine he calls
        his <i>blood, which is shed for you</i>. Both statements are indicative
        of the events to come.
        </p>

        <p>
        Again during dinner, after exposing that his betrayer was among his closest
        friends, he declares that even his betrayal is within the Father's plan:
        <i>truly the Son of Man goes as it has been determined</i>. Who is the
        determiner, but the Father? What is the course of the Son of Man? Suffering,
        and death.
        </p>

        <p>
        The Son of Man understands he is going to be betrayed. This is revealed five
        distinct ways (that I can identify). Yet he is determined that his Father's
        will would preside. This was a period of extreme temptation, which will be brought
        out next.
        </p>

        <p>
        That he is being tempted in these final hours is clear by his instruction
        to his disciples: <i>Pray, that you enter not into temptation</i> and
        <i>Why do you sleep? Rise and pray, lest you enter into temptation</i>.
        Temptation was so great no one could afford the luxury of sleep at
        this time. Prayer was necessary to avoid the test to come. And although
        Christ prays for Peter, his boldest disciple is still sifted as wheat.
        </p>

        <p>
        The temptation is clearly to avoid the suffering to come. He understands the extreme
        level of suffering he is about to endure, as was shown above. So he prays earnestly
        to the Father that he would <i>take this cup away</i>. This seemingly is a way of
        asking the Father to extract him from the coming suffering. Rather than giving into
        his desire to avoid pain, he submits to his Father's will. This is a fantastic 
        example of obedience.
