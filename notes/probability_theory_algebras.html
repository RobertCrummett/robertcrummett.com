		<h3>Notes &mdash; Probability Theory &mdash; Algebras</h3>

		<p>
		A probability space (&Omega;,&#x1D49C;,&#x2119;) consists of three elements.
		</p>

		<p>
		The first element is the <i>sample space</i> &Omega;. It
		is the space of all possible events. The second
		element is the <i>&sigma;-algebra</i>, &#x1D49C;. This is a
		collection of combinations of events in the sample space. In a
		sense, it is a set of sets. The final element is a function
		&#x2119;, which assigns a value to every element in &#x1D49C;.
		Each element of the probaility space deserves discussion.
		This article is dedicated to properties of the &sigma;-algebra
		&#x1D49C;.
		</p>

		<p>
		Algebras are collections of sets of &Omega; satisfying three properties:
		<ul>
			<li>
			&Omega; is a member of the algebra. That is,
			the realization of all possible events is contained
			in the algebra.
			</li>
			<li>
			The algebra is closed under compliments. The
			compliment (with respect to the set &Omega;) of any
			element in the algebra will yield another element 
			in the algebra.
			</li>
			<li>
			The algebra is closed under <b>finite</b> unions.
			</li>
		</ul>
		</p>

		<p>
		The last property is significant, because it is what distinguishes
		any algebra on &Omega; from a <i>&sigma;-algebra</i> on &Omega;.
		An algebra is called a &sigma;-algebra if it satisfies the
		additional property:
		<ul>
			<li>
			The algebra is closed under <b>countable</b> unions.
			</li>
		</ul>
		This final restriction distinguishes &#x1D49C; from more general
		algebras that could be formed on &Omega;.
		</p>

		<p>
		The collection &#x1D49C; must be a &sigma;-algebra if the triple
		(&Omega;,&#x1D49C;,&#x2119;) is to be a probability space. 
		The following results about algebras apply to probability spaces:
		</p>

		<p>
		<b>algebras contain &#x2205;</b><br>
		All algebras contain the entire sample space &Omega;. All
		algebras are also closed under compliment. Therefore, all
		algebras contain the compliment of the entire sample space,
		&Omega;<sup>c</sup>. This set is the empty set &#x2205;.
		</p>

		<p>
		<b>algebras are closed under intersection</b><br>
		Take a finite union of elements of an algebra. The set formed by
		the union is in the contained in the algebra, because of closure under
		finite unions. Call this set B. The compliment of this set B<sup>c</sup> is
		also contained in &#x1D49C;, because of closure under compliments. By
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan%27s_laws">De Morgan's law</a>,
		the compliment of a union of sets (i.e. B<sup>c</sup>) is equivalent to the
		intersection of the compliments of the sets. This shows
		that algebras are closed under finite intersections.
		</p>

		<p>
		Since 
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan%27s_laws">De Morgan's law</a>
		extends to countable unions, &sigma;-algebras can be said to be
		closed under countably many intersections. Algebras can
		generally only be said to be closed under finite intersections.
		</p>

		<p>
		<b>algebras are closed under differences</b><br>
		Set differences can be stated in terms of intersections, and the result follows.
