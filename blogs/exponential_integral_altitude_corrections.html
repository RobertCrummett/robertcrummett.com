		<h3>Exponential Integral for Radiometric Altitude Corrections Reviewed</h3>

		<p>
		Adjusting counts of airborne gamma-ray spectrometric surveys to
		a consistent altitude is standard operating proceedure in
		exploration geophysics. In the lowest portion of the
		atmosphere, gamma-quanta counts decay nearly exponentially with
		alititude. To prevent the altitude of the survey platform from
		influencing the interpretation of the total counts, or from
		biasing the ground concentrations counts will be converted
		into, we do our best to adjust the measured signal to a common
		altitude. Ideally this will give relatively equal weight to the
		counts at each sample location.
		</p>

		<p>
		How do we adjust the gamma-quanta counts measured at various altitudes
		to a common altitude? Well, very early on physicists observed that in the
		near surface environment, to first order gamma-quanta counts decay
		exponentially with distance from the ground. By observing quanta counts
		at various altitudes above a common source, we can estimate the sensitivity
		of the counts to altitude using an exponential function:
		</p>
 		
		<?-- Equation one -->
		<table width="100%">
			<tr>
		    	<td width="33%"><b>Eq. 1</b></td>
		    	<td width="34%" align="center">N = N<sub>0</sub> e<sup>-&mu;x</sup>,</td>
		    	<td width="33%"></td>
			</tr>
		</table>

		<p>
		where N is the counts at altitude x, N<sub>0</sub> is the counts at ground level, and
		&mu; is called the linear attenuation coefficient of air.
		</p>

		<p>
		This model for altitude corrections is simple and effective. Notice just how simple it is.
		There are only two hyperparameters: N<sub>0</sub> and &mu;. And just these two parameters do
		a nice job desribing a difficult problem: transport of high frequency photons through
		the lower atmosphere.
		</p>

		<p>
		The first parameter N<sub>0</sub> is the gamma-quanta counts at ground level. This can be measured in the
		field, or estimated based on various flight heights. It usually needs to be estimated, as will be pointed out later.
		The second paramter &mu; is almost always estimated. Thus the sensitivity of quanta counts to attenuation
		in the atmosphere can be turned into a two parameter optimization problem. In log-space, this could
		natually be posed as a <i>linear</i> overdetermined least-squares problem for log(N<sub>0</sub>) and &mu;.
