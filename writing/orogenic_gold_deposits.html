		<h3>Orogenic Gold Deposits</h3>

		<p>
		<i>My take-home thoughts after listening to Dr. Richard Goldfarb's lecture on orogenic gold deposits in New Developments in in the Geology & Exploration of Mineral Deposits, 2026.</i>
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>The purpose of a <b>deposit model</b> is to give us something to look for. We find deposit types by searching for deposit models.</li>
			<li><b>Recipe for an Orogenic Gold Deposit:</b> Bury rock pretty deep (more than 3 km). Metamorphose until water comes out. Focus the water. Regional heat and focused water makes the deposit.</li>
			<li><b>Recipe for an Intrusive Related Deposit:</b> Shallow (less than 3 km) intrusion. Boil the water in the rock. Water forms the deposit close to the intrusion. The heat source is the intrusion.</li>
			<li>Orogenic gold deposits have much greater potential to be preserved in geologic time than intrusive style deposits. Maybe this is just a consequence of being initially buried so deep, and the necessary time required to uplift the deposit before it can possibly weather.</li>
			<li>From a certain perspective, orogenic gold just means gold in metamorphic rocks.</li>
			<li>Volcanic massive sulfide deposits may be <i>spatially</i> and <i>temporally</i> correlated with orogenic gold deposits, but normally not <i>genetically</i> related.</li>
			<li>Granites may be <i>spatially</i> and <i>temporally</i> correlated with lamprophyres, but they are not necessarily <i>genetically</i> related.</li>
			<li><b>Spatio-temporal association does not imply genetic association.</b></li>
			<li>
			Major structure (key exploration principal 1/3)
			<ul>
				<li>Areas of most structurally complicated geology.</li>
				<li>Large structure necessary to focus metamorphic fluids.</li>
				<li>Deposits tend to be in secondary, nor primary, structure. Splay faults with 10<sup>o</sup>-25<sup>o</sup> deviation from average direction.</li>
				<li>Looks for competence contrasts. Think soft serpentinized/ultramaphic rocks deforming.</li>
				<li>High permeability zones.</li>
				<li>Anything that may generate space (pressure drops) underground.</li>
				<li>Tight anticlinal systems (Homestake Mine, South Dakota).</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
			Metamorphic grade (key exploration princial 2/3)
			<ul>
				<li>Greenschist is very, very common metamorphic grade associated with gold.</li>
				<li>After greenschist facies, metamorphism tends to release target metals. The important reaction is pyrite transforming into pyrrhotite.</li>
				<li>Fluids generated in prograde environment may migrate to retrograde environments. Deposition usually occurs in retrograde environments, do not rely on fluids to tell you otherwise.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
			Traps (key exploration princial 3/3)
			<ul>
				<li>Competent rocks can serve as greate <i>physical</i> traps.</li>
				<li>Banded iron formations can serve as <i>chemical</i> traps. Iron pulls surfur out of water, allowing gold to deposit.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Orogenic gold deposits usually occur in belts. When you find one, do not stop exploring!</li>
			<li>Lack of chlorine in orogenic gold deposits leads to poor Pb, Fe, Cu.</li>
			<li>In the orogenic world, temperature does not drop &mdash; the system behaves isothermally. Changes in redox state usually controls metal deposition.</li>
			<li>Zonation of metals in the system is gradual, not telescoped, due to moderate thermal gradients.</li>
			<li>The shape of orogenic gold deposits usually resembles a vertically oriented ellipsoid (5 km by 200 m by 200 m) at time of emplacement. The system forms along a vertical contact, which is which is why they elongate in one direction.</li>
			<li>Alteration is usually lateral (with repsect to the oritention of emplacement) and not vertical. The amount of alteration is variable. The deposits are not usually altered vertically because the temperature and pressure is the same at the top as it is at the bottom.</li>
			<li>The geophysical dream cross section is an alteration halo. From innermost zone to outermost zone: sulfides, sericitic, chloritic.</li>
			<li>Because the deposits are often found in greenschists, the cholrite and epidote alteration is really difficult to recognize in the green field setting.</li>
			<li>Always consider the entire geologic context, <b>at the time of emplacement.</b></li>
			<li>The tectonics at emplacement time is very important. Often orogenic gold deposits form when oceanic terrain (source of gold and water) is thrust under different terrain.</li>
